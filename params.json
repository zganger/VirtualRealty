{"name":"Virtual Realty","tagline":"","body":"# Virtual Realty\r\n\r\nA revamped and reimagined version of the classic board game, Monopoly, where a single user is embedded in a virtual reality board game against computer players. The game includes not only the physical board which is traversed autonomously by robotic pieces, but also the virtual board, where the player can virtually explore the game board and surroundings. Both the physical board and the virtual game work in tandem to preserve all the rules and components of the original Monopoly board game, while also giving the user the opportunity to explore the virtual world developed on the Oculus Rift through multiple vantage points. The virtual game will include visualization for the player’s properties, money, houses/hotels, and current board position. There will also be functions requiring user interface for rolling dice, reading chance/community chest cards, buying properties, and exploring the game board through both a “bird’s eye” view and a “walk-through” view. \r\n\r\n## Robot Requirements\r\n\r\n1. 3x3x3” size limit for robot’s internal circuitry, with a tolerance for extra space for wheels\r\n\r\n2. Robots must be capable of a speed of 4 in/s (1/3 ft/s)\r\n\r\n3. All of the Robot’s movements must be steady and continuous\r\n\r\n4.

Robots must know what game space they are currently occupying\r\n\r\n13. Robots must use a Kinetis Freescale processor \r\n\r\n## Oculus Requirements\r\n\r\n1. The Player must be able to view game play from a “bird’s eye view”\r\n\r\n2. In “bird’s eye view” the properties owned by the player must be reflected\r\n\r\n3. A secondary “piece view” must be available for the user to explore the board, pieces, and surroundings\r\n\r\n4.

All standard game assets in the original monopoly game (money, property, houses, hotels, and chance/community chest cards) must be tracked and apparent to the player\r\n\r\n6.
